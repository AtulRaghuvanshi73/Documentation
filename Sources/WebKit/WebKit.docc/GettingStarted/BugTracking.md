# Bug Tracking

## Overview

[bugs.webkit.org](https://bugs.webkit.org/) hosted is the primary bug tracking tool we use.
We use bugzilla to file bugs, and then perform code review using GitHub.

### Filing and Editing Bugs

To [file a new WebKit bug](https://bugs.webkit.org/enter_bug.cgi), see [reporting bugs](https://webkit.org/reporting-bugs/).
To edit an existing bug, you may need [editbug-bits](https://webkit.org/bugzilla-bits/).

### Reporting Security Bugs

Security bugs have their own components in [bugs.webkit.org](https://bugs.webkit.org/).
Weâ€™re also working on a new policy to delay publishing tests for security fixes until after the fixes have been widely deployed.

_***Do not post a patch or describe a security bug in a bug that is not in security component of bugs.webkit.org.***_
